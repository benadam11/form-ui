# Form UI 

##  Background

Doing the HackerRank challenge was an interesting experience for me.  I didn't really know what to expect, and budgeting my time was more of a challenge than I thought it would be (Especially when it came to designing that form).  I felt like I fumbled around for a while trying to make sense of what I wanted to accomplish.  At the end of the day I kind of hacked together a basic form that didn't really have any functionality. 

For the second portion of this interview, I wanted to add some more functionality to the form.  **Caveat - I still don't have a lot of context about how this form fits into the "rest of  (hypothetical) experience", and what the jobs that the user needs to accomplish are.  So the interactions demonstrated are a little bit contrived and may not actually represent "good UX".  

On a final note, as part of my growth as a designer, I have been pushing myself to grow in my Javascript skills.  One framework I have enjoyed lately is Veu.js.  It has a number of similar ideas to React (data down - actions up, component based design, optimized for speed and performance ).  I chose it because as a designer, it is more comfortable to deal with HTML templates and have a little bit more separation between your HTML and JS. Vue's API is incredibly simple and is something that can really be learned in a weekend, and thus seemed like a nice fit for this project.
